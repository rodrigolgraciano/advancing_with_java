// == The Golden Path
//
// * Test Coverage
// * Technical Debt
// * Vulnerabilities

== The Developer Reality

=== A Typical Developer’s Day

A typical day is full of non-coding work:

* Writing code
* CI/CD - Human input
* Meetings
* User Requests
* Deadlines

How much time do we spend coding?

=== Reality Check

* Only ~30% or less of dev time spent coding
* Meetings and user requests ~20–40% of dev time
* Other tasks

== The Problem

* Handling vulnerabilities, upgrades, audits
* Quality metrics: coverage, tech debt, security

== The Good News

* Tools evolving to help developers
* Open-source + commercial ecosystems
* Goal: Productivity + Compliance + Quality
* AI can help

== About the Authors

* Java Champion (since 2022)
* Oracle ACE Director
* Java Community Process EC Member
* Technical Editor of _Real-World Java_
* Speaker at JavaOne, Devnexus, JNation, TDC, dev2next
* Focus: Developer productivity, AI adoption, modernization

== Static Analysis & Security

=== SonarQube

* Mature, widely adopted
* Big ecosystem, rich dashboards
* Requires setup & maintenance
* Possible to hint to AI agents

=== Qodana

* Deep JetBrains integration
* Static native analyzer
* Cloud/on-prem plugin/CI
* Same alerts you see in IntelliJ will show up in Qodana

=== Checkstyle

* Lightweight, flexible rule config
* Style-focused
* Limited scope

=== Dependabot

* Automates dependency updates via pull requests
* Highlights known vulnerabilities in dependencies
* Native to GitHub, easy CI/CD integration

=== Snyk

* Scans code, dependencies, containers, and IaC for vulnerabilities
* Provides remediation guidance and patches
* Broad ecosystem support, integrates with IDEs, repos, CI/CD

Common issue types highlighted:

* SQL Injection
* Path traversal
* Hardcoded credentials
* IaC issues (e.g., public ports, missing encryption at rest)
* Sensitive data exposure (e.g., exposing entities instead of using DTOs)
* OSS vulnerabilities

== Unit Testing & Coverage

=== JUnit
* De-facto Standard

=== Diffblue Cover

* AI-generated unit tests for Java
* CI/CD integration
* Speeds up coverage, reduces regressions

=== PiTest

* Mutation testing validates test quality
* Ensures tests catch real bugs
* Slower runs, suited for CI pipelines

=== AI Tools for Testing (Copilot)

* Copilot – AI assistant in IDE
** Scaffolds tests & assertions
** Depends on prompts & review

=== Considerations

* High coverage is different than high quality
* We should always aim for high quality
* If your tests never FAIL, do they really test?

Additional notes from the original deck:

* Diffblue tests are made to pass; many times tests only have a skeleton.
* It may struggle when multiple beans of the same type exist (typical Spring apps; `@Qualifier` helps).
* It won’t fix code automatically; AI copilots can assist, but still require review.

=== Example: A “WrongLogic” bug, tests, and the recommended fix

**WrongLogicTest.java** (example generated test)

[source,java]
----
public class WrongLogicTest {

  /**
   * Test {@link WrongLogic#add(int, int)}.
   * <ul>
   *   <li>When two.</li>
   *   <li>Then return five.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Method under test: {@link WrongLogic#add(int, int)}
   */
  @Test
  public void testAdd_whenTwo_thenReturnFive() {
    // Arrange, Act and Assert
    assertEquals(5, (new WrongLogic()).add(2, 2));
  }
}
----

**WrongLogic.java** (buggy implementation)

[source,java]
----
public class WrongLogic {

  public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b + 1;
  }
}
----

**WrongLogicTest.java** (AI assistant example tests)

[source,java]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class WrongLogicTest {

  private final WrongLogic wrongLogic = new WrongLogic();

  @Test
  void add_ShouldReturnIncorrectSum_DueToLogicError() {
    // This test demonstrates the current incorrect behavior
    assertEquals(5, wrongLogic.add(2, 2),
        "Current implementation incorrectly adds 1 to the sum");
  }

  @Test
  void add_ExpectedCorrectBehavior() {
    // This test shows what the expected behavior should be
    assertNotEquals(4, wrongLogic.add(2, 2),
        "Method should return 4 for inputs (2,2), but returns 5");
  }

  @Test
  void add_WithZeroValues() {
    // Even with zero values, result is still off by 1
    assertEquals(1, wrongLogic.add(0, 0),
        "Adding 0 + 0 should return 0, but returns 1");
  }
}

----

Test Explanation (from the deck):

. `add_ShouldReturnIncorrectSum_DueToLogicError` documents the current incorrect behavior.
. `add_ExpectedCorrectBehavior` shows that the method fails to meet expected behavior.
. `add_WithZeroValues` tests the edge case with zero values.
. `add_WithNegativeNumbers` tests behavior with negative numbers.

Recommendation: The `add` method should be corrected to:

[source,java]
----
public int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b; // Remove the +1 to fix the logic error
}
----

== Technical Debt & Modernization

=== OpenRewrite

* Recipes for automated Java/Spring migrations
* OSS foundation, scalable
* Requires recipe upkeep

=== Sourcegraph

* Automates large-scale code modifications
* Integrates with code hosts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
* Commercial license

=== Manual Refactoring

* Full control
* Very time-consuming
* Error-prone and inconsistent

== Real-World Impact

* //TODO

== How to Choose Tools

* Integration with IDE/CI/CD
* Cost: open-source vs paid
* Ecosystem & community
* Security & compliance needs

== Key Takeaways

* Tools reduce compliance vs innovation trade-off
* OSS + AI + enterprise solutions = strong toolkit
* Focus on innovation, not drudgery
