== Provide instructions to all code-gen AI agents

=== • There isn’t *one* repo file that **every** coding assistant reads today
=== • Each product has its own “auto-loaded instructions” mechanism.
=== • The closest thing to a cross-agent **common** file AGENTS.md

=== Use `AGENTS.md` as your canonical “instructions for agents” file

`AGENTS.md` is an open, tool-agnostic convention meant to be a “README for coding agents,” and it supports nesting (so subprojects can override the root guidance). (link:https://agents.md/[Agents])

It’s also directly supported by major agentic tools:

* **OpenAI Codex** reads `AGENTS.md` files before work (and supports layered overrides). (link:https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md/[OpenAI Developers])
* **GitHub Copilot coding agent** supports `AGENTS.md` (and still supports Copilot’s own instruction formats). (link:https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-28-copilot-coding-agent-now-supports-agents-md-custom-instructions/[The GitHub Blog])

=== Then add thin “adapter” files for tools that *don’t* read `AGENTS.md`

Keep `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth, and duplicate the *top 10–20% most important rules* into each tool’s native file:

* **GitHub Copilot Chat / IDE Copilot**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (link:https://docs.github.com/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot[GitHub Docs])
  (Optionally add targeted rules in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` globs.) (link:https://docs.github.com/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot[GitHub Docs])
* **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md` (auto-discovered recursively). (link:https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory[Claude])
* **Cursor**: `.cursorrules` (many teams use this) or Cursor “Rules” files. (link:https://sbstjn.com/blog/ai-code-companion-cursor-rules/[sbstjn.com])

=== What to put in `AGENTS.md` (so it actually works)

Make it **short, concrete, testable**:

* Setup: exact build/test commands
* Definition of done: “tests + lint + format + security checks”
* Repo conventions: architecture rules, naming, where code lives
* Quality gates: e.g., “must satisfy Sonar rules / no new criticals”
* Safe defaults: how to mock external deps, how to run locally
* PR expectations: tests updated, changelog notes, etc.

If you want a practical approach: write a solid root `AGENTS.md`, then copy a small “Key rules” section into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.cursorrules` so whichever agent your team uses gets the same non-negotiables.
